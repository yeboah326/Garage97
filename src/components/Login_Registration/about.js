      <p>
        Then you are the reason we made this app. Do you find it difficult
        managing your business? Do you know which products provide you with the
        most profit? These and many others are the reason a group of 11 young
        and capable men of 'Garage 97' came together to put up this app.
      </p>

      <p>
        This app is made to help owners of small and medium scale businesses
        track their sales and profit margin. If you want to know which products
        give you the most profit and hence know where to invest most of your
        capital, then this is the app for you.
